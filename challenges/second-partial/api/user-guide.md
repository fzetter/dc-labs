# User Guide

###### RUN API

  The API runs on port 8081 per defect, so it's only needed to run the server as usual.

    ```bash
    go run app.go
    ```

###### NOTE FOR PROFESSOR

  I only just finished the API, that is why I couldn't make a detailed documentation for
  the user-guide and architecture, but I wrote the most important things.

  I encountered a lot of errors because I am unfamiliar with the Go language but I think
  I finished all the required points just in time.
